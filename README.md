# Exercise-3

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand `for` loops and conditional statements in Python.
Below you have a series of problems in which you are asked to edit the notebook files and write the code necessary to produce the desired results.

After making your changes to the notebook, you will need to upload it to GitHub.

- **Exercise 3 is due by the start of the next lesson (9 am, 25 September 2019)**.

- Don't forget to check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L3/exercise-3.html) if you're having trouble.

- Scores on this exercise are out of **20 points** based on solving all 3 problems. Problem 4 is optional.

## Before you start

### Check that your IPython is up-to-date

Our automatic grading system requires to have IPython version which is higher than 3. Test your version by running following lines of code in JupyterLab:

```python

import IPython
assert IPython.version_info[0] >= 3, "Your version of IPython is too old, please update it. Ask help, if you don't know how."
print("Your system is okay, you can continue! :) ")

```

### Clone the Exercise 3 repository

Before starting to work with the actual problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 3 repository (e.g. exercise-3-htenkanen) into the instance using Git as we saw in the [**lecture**](https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github) during week 2.

## Start working

There are 3 problems and 1 optional problem in this week's exercise:
